How to achieve this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Create  Folder In GitHub<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans. Creating a folder in GitHub involves following these steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Create a New Repository:<\/strong> If you don&#8217;t already have a repository, start by creating one. This is where your folder will reside. You can do this by clicking the &#8220;+ New&#8221; button on the top right corner of your GitHub profile.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Name Your Repository:<\/strong> Give your repository a name and provide an optional description.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Initialize with a README:<\/strong> You have the option to initialize your repository with a README file. You can choose to do this or leave it unchecked if you want to add files later.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Create the Folder:<\/strong> Once your repository is created, you&#8217;ll be on the main page of the repository. Click on the &#8220;Add file&#8221; dropdown button and select &#8220;Create new file.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Folder Naming:<\/strong> In the &#8220;Name your file\u2026&#8221; field, enter the desired folder name followed by a forward slash (<code>\/<\/code>). This tells GitHub you want to create a folder. For example, if you want a folder named &#8220;images,&#8221; you&#8217;d type &#8220;images\/&#8221;. GitHub will recognize this as a folder creation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Add a File in the Folder:<\/strong> To create an empty folder, you&#8217;ll need to add a file inside it. Enter the desired file name in the &#8220;Name your file\u2026&#8221; field, and make sure it follows the format &#8220;foldername\/filename&#8221;. For example, &#8220;images\/image1.png&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Commit Changes:<\/strong> Scroll down and you&#8217;ll see the option to &#8220;Commit new file.&#8221; Enter a commit message, which is a brief description of the changes you made, and then click the &#8220;Commit new file&#8221; button.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>View the Folder:<\/strong> Once the file is added, you&#8217;ll see your folder listed in the repository. You can add more files to the folder using the same process.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p> By following these steps, you&#8217;re essentially creating a file with a specific path that GitHub interprets as a folder.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I want to create folder in the GitHub repository and add files in that folder.
