The default replication scheme for a new Azure Storage Account depends on the region where the storage account is created. Azure Storage offers three replication options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Locally Redundant Storage (LRS): In this replication scheme, data is replicated within a single data center in the same region. LRS provides a low-cost option for protecting your data against local hardware failures within that data center. However, it does not protect against datacenter-level outages.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS): GRS is the default replication option for most Azure regions. In GRS, your data is replicated synchronously to a secondary data center in a different geographic region, providing additional data durability and availability in case of a regional outage. The secondary region is typically hundreds of miles away from the primary region.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS): RA-GRS includes the benefits of GRS but also allows read access to the data in the secondary region. This means you can read your data from the secondary region in addition to the primary region. It&#8217;s useful for scenarios where you want to have read-only access to your data even if the primary region is experiencing an outage.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I wanted to know what the current replication scheme is for my storage account What Are The Default Replication Schemes For Storage Account In Azure Answer.
