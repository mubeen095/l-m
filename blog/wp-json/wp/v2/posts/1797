If you want to &#8220;unfork&#8221; a repository, it means you want to disconnect your forked repository from the original repository. This essentially means you want to stop tracking changes from the original repository.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To &#8220;unfork&#8221; a repository in GitHub, you need to delete your forked repository. Here&#8217;s how you can do it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Go to Your Repository:<\/strong> First, navigate to the forked repository that you want to unfork. This is the repository under your GitHub account.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Click on &#8220;Settings&#8221;:<\/strong> Click on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab, which is usually located on the right-hand side of the repository&#8217;s menu bar.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scroll Down to the Danger Zone:<\/strong> Scroll down to the bottom of the settings page, and you will see a section called &#8220;Danger Zone.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Click on &#8220;Delete this repository&#8221;:<\/strong> In the &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; section, you will find an option called &#8220;Delete this repository.&#8221; Click on it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Confirm the Deletion:<\/strong> You will be asked to confirm the deletion by typing the name of the repository. This is a safety measure to ensure you don&#8217;t accidentally delete it. Enter the repository name and click the &#8220;I understand the consequences, delete this repository&#8221; button.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve completed these steps, your forked repository will be permanently deleted, and it will be &#8220;unforked&#8221; from the original repository. Any changes you&#8217;ve made to the forked repository will no longer be associated with the original repository. Keep in mind that this action is irreversible, so be absolutely sure you want to delete the fork before confirming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you only want to stop tracking updates from the original repository but want to keep your forked repository, you can simply disconnect it by going to the &#8220;Settings&#8221; of the forked repository and clicking on the &#8220;Unwatch&#8221; or &#8220;Unstar&#8221; option, depending on how you&#8217;re tracking updates from the original repository. This will stop you from receiving notifications and updates from the original repository.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How To Unfork In GitHub Repository Ans.
