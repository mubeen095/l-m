What is the MERN stack best for?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. The MERN stack enables developers to create and launch applications from the very beginning. React, a part of MERN, simplifies managing quick changes in data and helps in creating excellent user interfaces. MERN is particularly well-suited for smaller projects, whether they are single-page apps or mobile apps.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1702531408111\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q2. Why do we need MERN stack?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. The MERN stack is a set of technologies that speeds up application development and is widely used by developers globally. The key reason for using the MERN stack is its focus on developing apps exclusively with JavaScript. All four technologies in this stack\u2014MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js\u2014are based on JavaScript, making it a cohesive and streamlined choice for building applications.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1702531419138\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q3.
