It creates and runs virtual machines (VMs), each of which can run its own operating system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.<strong>Virtualization:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage device, or network resources. It enables the running of multiple operating systems or applications on a single physical machine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.<strong>Containerization<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that encapsulates an application and its dependencies into a container. Containers share the host operating system&#8217;s kernel and isolate the application processes, making them portable and efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.<strong>Difference between Virtualization and Containerization:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>In virtualization, each VM includes a full operating system, and multiple VMs run on a hypervisor. In containerization, containers share the host OS kernel, and each container encapsulates only the application and its dependencies.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Virtual machines are generally slower to start and consume more resources than containers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Containers are more lightweight, portable, and can be quickly scaled up or down compared to virtual machines.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>5.<strong>Docker:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It provides tools and a runtime for creating and managing containers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.<strong>Docker Container:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.<strong>Docker Images:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Docker images are the blueprints for containers. They are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include application code, runtime, libraries, and system tools required to run an application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8.<strong>Docker Hub:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service that allows you to share Docker images publicly or privately. It serves as a repository for Docker images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9.<strong>Docker Architecture:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which is responsible for building, running, and managing containers. The daemon can run on the same host or connect to a remote daemon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10.<strong>Dockerfile:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, adds layers for application code and dependencies, and configures the container environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11.<strong>Docker Compose:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define the services, networks, and volumes in a YAML file and then start and manage them with a single command.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12.<strong>Docker Swarm:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration solution for Docker. It allows you to create and manage a swarm of Docker nodes, turning them into a single, virtual Docker host.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13.<strong>Docker Namespace:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.Docker uses namespaces to isolate containers from each other. Namespaces provide a layer of isolation for various system resources, such as process IDs, network, and file systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14.<strong>Lifecycle of a Docker Container:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Create:<\/strong> A container is created from a Docker image.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Run:<\/strong> The container is started, and the application within it begins to run.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pause:<\/strong> The container&#8217;s processes are paused (optional).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stop:<\/strong> The container is stopped, and its processes are halted.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Restart:<\/strong> The container is restarted.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Remove:<\/strong> The container is removed from the system.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Commit:<\/strong> The changes made in a container can be committed to create a new Docker image.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1.
