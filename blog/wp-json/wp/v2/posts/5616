To help you navigate this world, we&#8217;ve put together a list of the &#8220;10 Best-Selling  Data Science Books of 2024.&#8221; These books are carefully chosen to give you the most up-to-date and useful insights. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re already experienced in data science or just starting out, these books are here to guide you through the exciting world of data in the coming year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"data-science-books-2024\">Data Science Books 2024<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4754\" height=\"3188\" src=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/pexels-pixabay-159866-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6166\" style=\"width:500px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-everybody-lies\">1. <strong>EVERYBODY LIES<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/builtin.com\/sites\/www.builtin.com\/files\/styles\/ckeditor_optimize\/public\/inline-images\/national\/everybody-lies-data-science-books_1_0.png\" alt=\"Everybody Lies Data Science Book\" style=\"width:328px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book&nbsp;is very similar to &nbsp;<em>Freakonomics<\/em>&nbsp;in the age of&nbsp;data science. It\u2019s not a technical book. Every chapter will include a peculiar story that has a data science concept. Whereas,  one chapter is about Google searches, another about news, another about image data, etc. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can see stories of people being creative and finding patterns in the most random things because these random things can reveal a lot.  We can lie about the food and the books we read. But, that doesn&#8217;t work for the search history. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a book intended for people who are curious about what data science is and what it can do especially in the field of social data. The author has ended this book by stating the next Freud will be a&nbsp;data scientist, the next Foucault will be a data scientist, and the next Marx will be a data scientist. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-naked-statistics\">2. <strong>NAKED STATISTICS<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/builtin.com\/sites\/www.builtin.com\/files\/styles\/ckeditor_optimize\/public\/inline-images\/national\/naked-statistics-data-science-books_1.png\" alt=\"naked statistics data science books\" style=\"width:266px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book&nbsp;will provide several examples of how statistical concepts will apply in the real world. Wheelan hasn&#8217;t discussed more about the theory, even though he has some pretty interesting examples and a kind of dry sense of humor. This statistics book will make people laugh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-weapons-of-math-destruction\"><strong>\u200b3.

Such as someone purchased an item at a particular shop and automatically got their credit card limit lowered, or a college student couldn\u2019t get a job at a local grocery store because the algorithm said so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She doesn\u2019t just say \u201cboo hoo, bad algorithm, bad machine!\u201d though \u2014 she makes an effort to explain the mechanisms that might&nbsp;make an algorithm racist, for instance. So, why is a policing algorithm sending officers to Black neighborhoods more often? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, what happened in that case is that the algorithm was fed data on previous police patrols, which were more often in Black neighborhoods. So the algorithm learned that those neighborhoods are the ones that receive more patrols. The algorithm simply reproduced what it was taught. The book makes you think a lot about how you can design algorithms and data science practices to deal with that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-algorithms-of-oppression\">4.<strong>ALGORITHMS OF OPPRESSION<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/builtin.com\/sites\/www.builtin.com\/files\/styles\/ckeditor_optimize\/public\/inline-images\/national\/algorithms-of-oppression-data-science-books_1.png\" alt=\"algorithms of oppression data science books\" style=\"width:311px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book&nbsp;has a few stories, with very simple \u201cdata,\u201d which the author explores in depth. The author discusses the percent qualitative, telling stories based on \u201csmall data\u201d with a lot of context.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The author, Safiya Noble, was organizing a party for her niece and other children, so, she searched  \u201cBlack girls\u201d on Google.

This book has statistical knowledge to understand what\u2019s going on in that black box.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This person is meant for those who don&#8217;t have any programming or statistics background. Even if you&#8217;re a seasoned data scientist, it&#8217;s common to forget certain statistical concepts over time. In real work situations, you may not use every algorithm regularly, and you might become comfortable with your usual methods. This book serves as a helpful reminder, encouraging you to consider trying out different algorithms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-data-science-from-scratch\">6. <strong>DATA SCIENCE FROM SCRATCH<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/builtin.com\/sites\/www.builtin.com\/files\/styles\/ckeditor_optimize\/public\/inline-images\/national\/data-science-from-scratch-data-science-books_1.png\" alt=\"data science from scratch data science books\" style=\"width:359px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on teaching how to write data science algorithms using Python. It&#8217;s a unique blend, somewhat like a mix between a textbook and a regular book, making it ideal for beginners. Whether you&#8217;re a layperson or just starting out, this book provides a great entry point. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you want to learn the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm, the book takes a hands-on approach. It guides you through programming Naive Bayes from scratch, starting with the math and then building the code using only Python.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While having a basic understanding of Python and some knowledge of statistics can be helpful, the book assumes minimal prior knowledge. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-hands-on-machine-learning-with-scikit\">7. <strong>HANDS-ON MACHINE LEARNING WITH SCIKIT<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/builtin.com\/sites\/www.builtin.com\/files\/styles\/ckeditor_optimize\/public\/inline-images\/national\/hands-on-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-keras-and-tensorflow-data-science-books_1.png\" alt=\"hands on machine learning with scikit learn keras and tensorflow data science books\" style=\"width:273px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book&nbsp;will provide us with how to run&nbsp;predictive analytics. In the data science world, there are two main&nbsp;programming languages: Python and R. However, this book covers mostly the  Python.&nbsp;Scikit-Learn,&nbsp;Keras,&nbsp;and&nbsp;TensorFlow&nbsp;are all libraries of machine learning and deep learning functions within Python programming languages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One should have good knowledge about these libraries to be a data scientist. This book is very helpful for beginners as it goes deep into explaining how each algorithm works. The author explains what those different knobs and levers are for beginners to understand, but someone with more experience can appreciate the level of detail that he goes into.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-think-stats\">8.

One is programming and&nbsp;computer science; and another is&nbsp;linear algebra, stats, and very math-heavy analytics; and then one is&nbsp;machine learning&nbsp;and algorithms. The data scientist&nbsp;is good at all of them. But that doesn\u2019t always happen, so&nbsp;this book&nbsp;mostly focuses on building out the analytics, math, and stats side of your data science knowledge. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s textbook-y. It will `merge the statistical analysis with how you would write it in Python.
