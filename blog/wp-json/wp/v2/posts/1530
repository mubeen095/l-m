Go is a language made by Google that&#8217;s known for being straightforward and useful for many types of computer tasks. This guide will help you learn to Go, even if you&#8217;ve never programmed before. By the end, you&#8217;ll have a good starting point to use Go for all sorts of projects. Let&#8217;s get started and learn to Go from scratch!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-go\">What is Go?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Go has become increasingly popular in recent years, and there are several compelling reasons behind its rise:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Speed and Efficiency:<\/strong> Go is known for its speed and efficiency. It efficiently manages memory using its built-in garbage collector, which means it doesn&#8217;t waste resources and runs quickly. Additionally, Go boasts fast compilation times, making it a great choice for developers who value efficiency.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Static Typing:<\/strong> Go is a statically typed language, which means that variable types are determined and checked at compile time. This provides strong type safety, helping catch errors early in the development process and improving code reliability.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Clean and Concise Syntax:<\/strong> Go&#8217;s syntax is clean and concise, making it easier for programmers to read and write code. Its simplicity encourages good coding practices and reduces the likelihood of errors caused by complex language features.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>C-Like Language:<\/strong> If you&#8217;re familiar with the C programming language, you&#8217;ll find Go to be somewhat familiar. Go has borrowed many features from C, making the transition for C programmers relatively smooth. This familiarity can be advantageous for those with prior C experience.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, Go&#8217;s popularity is driven by its speed, efficiency, static typing for reliability, clean syntax, and its familiarity to C programmers. These qualities make Go an excellent choice for a wide range of applications, from web development to system-level programming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-learn-go-programming\">Why Learn  Go Programming <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Simple Syntax:<\/strong> Go uses a neat and easy-to-understand programming language. This simplicity makes it beginner-friendly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scalability:<\/strong> Programs written in Go can efficiently adjust their memory usage, making them highly scalable for different needs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fewer Keywords:<\/strong> Go has a limited set of keywords, around 25, so developers don&#8217;t need to memorize a lot of them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Useful Standard Libraries:<\/strong> Go comes with a bunch of built-in libraries that make it super convenient to write programs. These libraries save time and effort in coding.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"requirements-of-learning-go\">Requirements Of Learning Go<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have some programming experience and want to get started with Go, you&#8217;ll need a few things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Knowledge of Functions:<\/strong> It&#8217;s helpful to understand how functions work in programming. They are essential building blocks in Go, as in many other languages.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Text Editor:<\/strong> You&#8217;ll need a text editor to write your Go code. You can use any text editor you like, but some popular ones with good Go support are VSCode (free), GoLand (paid), and Vim (free).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Command Terminal:<\/strong> Go works well with various terminals. If you&#8217;re on Linux or Mac, your default terminal will work fine. On Windows, you can use PowerShell or cmd.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11-different-ways-to-learn-go\">11 Different Ways To Learn Go <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-official-go-documentation\">1.
