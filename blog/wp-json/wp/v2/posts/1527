Can you explain this with some examples?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Difference Between Informed And Uninformed Search<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Answer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Informed and uninformed searches are two categories of algorithms used in computer science and artificial intelligence to find solutions to problems. The main difference between them lies in how they explore a search space and make decisions. Let&#8217;s explore these differences with examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Informed Search (Heuristic Search):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Informed search algorithms use additional information, often in the form of heuristics, to guide their search process. Heuristics are rules or estimates that provide information about how close a particular state is to the goal. These algorithms prioritize nodes that are more likely to lead to a solution based on this heuristic information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong> A* Search Algorithm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider a maze-solving problem where you have a maze and need to find the shortest path from the start point to the exit. In this case, an informed search algorithm like A* search can be used. A* utilizes a heuristic function that estimates the distance from each state to the goal. It then considers the sum of the actual cost to reach a state and the heuristic estimate. A* prioritizes expanding states that have lower estimated costs. This helps it efficiently find the shortest path through the maze.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Uninformed Search (Blind Search):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uninformed search algorithms do not use any additional knowledge or heuristics about the problem domain. They explore the search space without considering how close a particular state is to the goal. These algorithms often have a systematic approach to exploration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 1:<\/strong> Breadth-First Search (BFS)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breadth-First Search is an example of an uninformed search algorithm. It explores the search space level by level, starting from the initial state and expanding all successor states before moving deeper. In a maze-solving scenario, BFS explores all possible paths systematically, ensuring that it finds the shortest path because it expands nodes in increasing order of their distance from the start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:<\/strong> Depth-First Search (DFS)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depth-First Search, another uninformed search algorithm, explores as deeply as possible along one branch of the search tree before backtracking. In the maze example, DFS may not guarantee finding the shortest path because it can explore deeply along one path before exploring other options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, the choice between informed and uninformed search depends on the problem and the available domain knowledge. Informed search algorithms are more efficient when you have relevant information, while uninformed searches are more suitable for situations where you lack such information or need to ensure completeness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is the difference between informed and uninformed searches?
