Through this article, we are looking at the various difference between class and structure in C++. A structure will perform the same way as a class regardless of those two differences. Their major function is hiding implementation details. Hence, in short, the structure will provide its implementation details for its users. Whereas, a class won&#8217;t show its implementation details and thus will indeed restrict the programmer from accessing it. The table below represents the difference between class and structure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-and-structure\">Class And Structure <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Class <\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Structure <\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Members of the class are not revealed to everyone.<\/td><td>Members of the class are revealed to everyone.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A &#8220;class&#8221; is a blueprint, and an &#8220;object&#8221; is what you create based on that blueprint.<br><\/td><td>In structure, use that blueprint to create an actual structure in memory, we call it an &#8220;object&#8221; or &#8220;structure instance.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>All programming languages have default behavior even though their members are private.<\/td><td>In OOP languages, use <code>class<\/code> keywords to create a blueprint for objects with attributes and behaviors.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br><br>Whereas, class is responsible for grouping data.<br><br><br><br><\/td><td>A structure is declared using the <code>struct<\/code> keyword.

What is a structure in C++ for example?<br><\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans.Structures (structs) group related variables (members) of different data types together. Example: An employee&#8217;s will include details of salary, position, experience, etc. Hence, it will be stored in one single variable using structures.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1690887859055\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q 2. How many types of structures are there in C++?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. In C++, structures can have two types of members: data members (variables of different types) and member functions (normal C++ functions).<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1690887860987\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q3.What is an array of structures in C++?<br><\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. An array is a collection of data items of the same type, like int, char, float, etc. In contrast, a structure allows elements of different data types to be grouped together under a single name.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Difference Between Class and Structure in C++ In the era of programming, We are aware of how C++ programming has evolved over time.
