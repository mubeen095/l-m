It involves two primary operations push and pop . We know that the top element was added to the stack and has push and pop operations. Whereas, the pop operation can remove an element from the top and the push operation can add an element to the stack. Computer memory management and programming both can use the stack notion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Stack will contain programming language and suitable technology. These will have either application stacks or technology stacks. Also, the former has a cross-disciplinary word which is available in the software development process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"full-stack-vs-mern-stack-head-to-head-comparison\"><strong>Full Stack vs MERN Stack: Head-to-Head Comparison<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>parameter<\/td><td><strong>Full Stack&nbsp;<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Mern Stack<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Essential Libraries<\/strong><\/td><td>The full stack has  jQuery, LESS, and other essential libraries.<\/td><td>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.knowledgehut.com\/blog\/web-development\/mern-stack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MERN stack<\/a>&nbsp;has  extra libraries for third-party support.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Architecture<\/strong><\/td><td>A full stack consists of  3 Tier Web Architecture from an architectural standpoint.<\/td><td>A MERN stack has a  Smooth UI Rendering architecture.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Frameworks<\/strong><\/td><td>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.knowledgehut.com\/blog\/web-development\/full-stack-developer-frameworks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">full stack development framework<\/a>&nbsp;runs for large-scale apps and projects.<\/td><td>MERN stack is best suited for smaller sample projects, such as single-page applications or mobile apps.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Development Mode<\/strong><\/td><td>Full-stack developers are experienced in every aspect of software development in their field.<\/td><td>MERN Stack is only applicable to web development.

This whole set of technologies is called full-stack technology. A full-stack developer can handle everything from making the visible parts of a site look great (Front End) to dealing with the behind-the-scenes stuff (Back End).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They work on the Front End Technology (what you see on a website), Back End Development Languages (the hidden code that makes things work), Version Controlling Systems (keeping track of changes), Servers (where the website or app is hosted), APIs (ways different parts of software talk to each other), and Databases (where information is stored).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full-stack developers have the freedom to create awesome user interfaces and use various technologies in the background. They start from scratch and end up with a fully functioning website or app. The full stack is made up of four important parts: Front-end, Back-end, Testing, and Mobile app. They cover everything needed to create a complete software solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-difference-between-full-stack-and-mern-stack\">Key Difference Between Full Stack And Mern Stack<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>a.<strong>Productivity:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Full Stack development is considered more productive than MERN Stack development.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>b.<strong>Libraries:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A complete stack includes jQuery, LESS, and other necessary libraries.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>MERN stack requires additional libraries for third-party support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>c.<strong>Architecture:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Full Stack requires 3 Tier Web Architecture.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>MERN stack uses Smooth UI Rendering architecture, providing a rich and easily generated user interface.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>d.<strong>Scalability:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>MERN stack is more scalable than full-stack development.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Full stack development is suitable for large-scale apps, while MERN is better for niche projects like single-page applications or mobile apps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>e.<strong>Development Mode of Full Stack:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Full-stack developers are well-versed in all aspects of software development, including Mobile App Development, PC Software Development, and Web Development.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>f.<strong>Development Mode of MERN Stack:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>MERN Stack is specifically designed for web development.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>MERN Stack developers are skilled in various aspects of JavaScript and are familiar with both back-end development frameworks (NodeJS, MongoDB, Express) and front-end frameworks (ReactJS).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, Full Stack development is seen as more productive, the full stack includes essential libraries, and it follows a 3 Tier Web Architecture. MERN Stack, on the other hand, is preferred for its smooth UI rendering architecture, scalability for niche projects, and suitability for smaller sample projects like single-page applications or mobile apps.
