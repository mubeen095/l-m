styles or structure to them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>&lt;span&gt;<\/code> is an inline element used for styling specific parts of text or inline elements.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>&lt;div&gt;<\/code> typically starts on a new line and takes up the full width available, while <code>&lt;span&gt;<\/code> stays within the flow of the surrounding content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>4.<strong>React JS:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to create reusable UI components.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It uses a virtual DOM for efficient rendering and updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>React follows a unidirectional data flow and supports a declarative syntax for defining UI components.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>5.<strong>Advantages of REST Web Services:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Simplicity and scalability.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stateless communication.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wide adoption and compatibility with various programming

Model (DOM).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>CSS is applied to the DOM, creating the Render Tree.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Layout involves determining the position and size of each element.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Render Tree is painted to the screen.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>JavaScript can manipulate the DOM and trigger reflows or repaints.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>7.<strong>Grid System in CSS:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A grid system in CSS is a layout system that allows for a grid-based structure in web design.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It consists of columns and rows that make it easier to design responsive and consistent layouts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Popular grid systems include Bootstrap Grid, CSS Grid Layout, and Flexbox.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>8.<strong>Class vs. Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Class Inheritance:<\/strong> Introduced in ES6, it allows for creating classes and extends relationships between them. It provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from other object-oriented languages.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prototypal Inheritance:<\/strong> In JavaScript, objects inherit from other objects directly. Each object has a prototype object, and if a property is not found on the object itself, it looks up the prototype chain until it finds the property or reaches the end.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"9\">\n<li><strong>User-Centered Design:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Definition:<\/strong> User-Centered Design (UCD) is an iterative design process that focuses on the needs and experiences of the end user. It involves users throughout the design and development process to ensure that the final product meets their expectations and requirements.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Key Principles:<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>User Involvement:<\/strong> Actively involve users in the design process through techniques like user testing, interviews, and feedback sessions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Iterative Design:<\/strong> Continuously refine and improve the design based on user feedback and testing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Usability:<\/strong> Prioritize the usability of the product, ensuring it is easy to use and understand for the target audience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Accessibility:<\/strong> Consider the diverse needs and abilities of users, including those with disabilities, to create an inclusive design.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>10.<strong>Clickjacking:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Definition:<\/strong> Clickjacking, also known as a UI (User Interface) redress attack, is a malicious technique where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives. The attacker overlays or disguises one website element over another, leading the user to unintentionally perform actions without their knowledge.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>How it Works:<\/strong> The attacker often uses iframes or transparent layers to cover an innocuous-looking element (like a button) on a website with a malicious element. When the user clicks what they see, they are actually interacting with the hidden, malicious element.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prevention:<\/strong> To prevent clickjacking, web developers can use techniques like frame-busting scripts, X-Frame-Options HTTP header, and ensuring that their web applications cannot be embedded within iframes on other domains without permission. Users can also protect themselves by being cautious about clicking on unfamiliar or unexpected elements on web pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1.
