Differentiating var, let, and const in JavaScript:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>var:<\/strong> Global or function-scoped, can be reassigned, prone to accidental reassignment and scope issues.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>let:<\/strong> Block-scoped, can be reassigned within its block, prevents accidental global reassignment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>const:<\/strong> Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned, enforces data immutability, improves code clarity and security.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-asynchronous-code-execution-and-popular-methods\">8. Asynchronous code execution and popular methods:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Asynchronous code:<\/strong> Executes without blocking the main thread, allowing other code to run concurrently.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Promise:<\/strong> Represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, allowing for chained callbacks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>async\/await:<\/strong> Syntactic sugar for working with promises, making asynchronous code feel more synchronous.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-closures-and-their-practical-use-cases\">9.Closures and their practical use cases:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Closures:<\/strong> Functions that retain access to the environment of their creation, even after the function itself has returned.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Practical use cases:<\/strong> Implementing private variables, currying functions, creating reusable modules, simulating state management.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-event-bubbling-and-capturing-in-java-script\">10.Event bubbling and capturing in JavaScript:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Event bubbling:<\/strong> Events propagate up the DOM tree, reaching ancestor elements after targeting the child element.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Event capturing:<\/strong> Events propagate down the DOM tree, reaching descendant elements before targeting the child element.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Impact on event handling:<\/strong> Used to capture events before they reach their target, or to handle them at different levels of the DOM hierarchy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11-props-vs-state-in-react-js\">11. Props vs. state in React.js:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Props:<\/strong> Data passed down from parent to child components, immutable, used for configuring and rendering the child component.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>State:<\/strong> Internal data managed by a component, mutable, changes trigger re-rendering of the component and its children.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Impact on behavior:<\/strong> Props define the initial state and behavior of a component, while state allows the component to dynamically change its behavior based on user interaction or internal logic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"faq-60-mern-stack-basic-interview-questions\">FAQ- 60 Mern Stack Basic Interview Questions<\/h2>\n\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1702555359952\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q1.
