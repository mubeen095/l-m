It offers the following features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Performance<\/strong>: Premium SSDs deliver fast and consistent performance due to their use of solid-state drives. This is suitable for applications that require high I\/O throughput and low latency, such as databases and application servers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Low Latency<\/strong>: SSDs have lower access times and latency compared to traditional spinning hard drives, making them ideal for applications that demand quick data retrieval.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>I\/O Operations<\/strong>: Premium SSDs offer a high number of IOPS, which is crucial for applications with heavy read\/write operations, like databases and virtualized environments.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reliability<\/strong>: While no storage system is completely immune to failure, Premium SSDs are designed for high reliability and have built-in redundancy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Premium SSDs are typically used in conjunction with Azure Virtual Machines, allowing you to choose the right balance of CPU, memory, and storage performance to meet your application&#8217;s requirements. When creating a virtual machine in Azure, you can select Premium SSDs as the storage option for the OS disk or data disks, depending on your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Azure also offers other storage types, including Standard HDD, Standard SSD, and Ultra Disk Storage, each with its own performance characteristics and use cases. Your choice of storage depends on your specific workload requirements and cost considerations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am confused if it&#8217;s the premium or the standard disk that is used for this purpose.
