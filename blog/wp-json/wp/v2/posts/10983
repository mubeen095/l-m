These Infosys interview questions will improve your knowledge about commonly asked questions and provide you, with an understanding of how to answer those Infosys interview questions.  The generally asked 13 Infosys interview questions are listed  below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.<\/strong> <strong>What is a Constructor?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. A constructor is a special function in a class that is automatically called when creating a new class object. It has the same name as the class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The compiler provides a default if you don&#8217;t define a constructor. However, the compiler won&#8217;t create a default constructor if you define your constructor (with or without parameters).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. What do you mean by access specifiers?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. When you define a class, you can control how its members (functions and variables) can be accessed from other parts of your code using access specifiers. There are three types of access specifiers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>private<\/strong>: Private members can only be accessed from within the same class where they are defined. They cannot be accessed from outside that class.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>public<\/strong>: Public members can be accessed anywhere in your code, inside and outside the class.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>protected<\/strong>: Protected members can be accessed from within the same class where they are defined,  from any child classes inherited from that class. However, they cannot be accessed from code outside the class and child classes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The protected access specifier is particularly useful when dealing with inheritance, as it allows child classes to access and modify the protected members of their parent class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.  What is the purpose of the <code>__init__.py<\/code> file in a Python package?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An<\/strong>s.The <code>__init__.py<\/code> file is executed when the package is imported. This allows you to &#8211; run the initialization code for the package. For instance, you might set up package-level variables or configurations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Namespace Indicator<\/strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It indicates to Python that the directory should be treated as a package. Without this file, Python will not recognize the directory as a package, preventing it from being imported.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Controlling Package Imports<\/strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>By defining the <code>__all__<\/code> list in the <code>__init__.py<\/code> file, you can control what is imported when using the <code>from package import *<\/code> syntax. This list should contain the names of the modules and sub-packages you want to be accessible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Modularization<\/strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It allows you to modularize your code by organizing it into a package with sub-modules. The <code>__init__.py<\/code> file can import sub-modules and make them available at the package level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.  Explain the difference between <code>*args<\/code> and <code>**kwargs<\/code> in function definitions.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. In Python, <code>*args<\/code> and <code>**kwargs<\/code> are used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><code>*args<\/code><\/strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>*args<\/code> is used to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function. Inside the function, <code>*args<\/code> is accessible as a tuple containing the arguments passed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example <\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>def my_function(*args):\n    for arg in args:\n        print(arg)\n\n# Calling the function with variable number of arguments\nmy_function(1, 2, 3)\nmy_function('a', 'b', 'c')<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Output<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>1\n2\n3\na\nb\nc<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong><code>kwargs<\/code><\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>**kwargs<\/code> is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. Inside the function, <code>**kwargs<\/code> is accessible as a dictionary containing the argument names and values.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>def my_function(**kwargs):\n    for key, value in kwargs.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\n# Calling the function with variable number of keyword arguments\nmy_function(name=\"Alice\", age=30, city=\"Wonderland\")\nmy_function(fruit=\"Apple\", color=\"Red\")<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Output<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>name: Alice\nage: 30\ncity: Wonderland\nfruit: Apple\ncolor: Red<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. What is inheritance? Name its types.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. One of the most important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) is inheritance. Inheritance allows one class to use the properties and methods of another class. This helps make the code more reusable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different types of inheritance:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Single inheritance<\/strong>: A class inherits from one parent class.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multi-level inheritance<\/strong>: A class inherits from a parent class and another class is formed from that class.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hierarchical inheritance<\/strong>: Multiple classes inherit from the same parent class.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multiple inheritance<\/strong>: A class inherits from more than one parent class.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hybrid inheritance<\/strong>: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multipath inheritance<\/strong>: Involves multiple inheritance paths to a common base class.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6.<\/strong> <strong>Why do we use stdio. h in a program?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. In C programming, &#8220;stdio&#8221; stands for &#8220;standard input-output.&#8221; When you write <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<\/code> at the beginning of your code, the computer &#8211; includes the standard input-output library in your program. This library provides functions, <code>printf<\/code> and <code>scanf<\/code>, which you can use to input and output data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<\/code> as a special instruction to the computer before your code is run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7.<\/strong> <strong>What is the use of return 0?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. In most C and C++ programs, the <code>main<\/code> function has a return type of <code>int<\/code>. This means it should return an integer value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a program finishes running, it sends a message such as  &#8220;exit status&#8221; back to the operating system. This exit status indicates whether the program ran successfully or encountered an error.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To indicate that the program ran successfully, we use <code>return 0;<\/code> at the end of the <code>main<\/code> function. This tells the operating system that everything went well and the program ended successfully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. What is a Database Management System?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. A database management system (DBMS) is a special tool that helps you build databases. It&#8217;s software that lets you create, organize, and control databases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a DBMS, regular people like you and me can create and look after databases without  the experts. It&#8217;s like a bridge between us (the users) and the databases, helping us interact with them easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. What is database Schema<\/strong>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. The rules that keep the data in a database safe and organized are known as database schema. It&#8217;s like a set of instructions that tells the database how to store and handle information correctly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10.<\/strong> <strong>Differentiate between TRUNCATE and DELETE commands in SQL.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>FEATURES <\/strong><\/td><td><strong>TRUNCATE<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>DELETE<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Operation<\/td><td>Removes all rows from a table quickly.<\/td><td>Deletes specific rows from a table.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rollback<\/td><td>It can&#8217;t be rolled back.<\/td><td>It can be rolled back using a transaction.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Auto Increment<\/td><td>Resets auto-incremented identity columns to start from 1.<\/td><td>Does not reset auto-incremented identity columns.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Permissions<\/td><td>Requires <code>ALTER<\/code> and <code>DROP<\/code> table permissions.<\/td><td>Requires <code>DELETE<\/code> table permissions.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. What is the difference between a session and a socket?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Aspect <\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Session <\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Socket <\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Definition<\/strong><\/td><td>A session is a series of interactions between a client and a server, maintained for the particular activity.<\/td><td>A socket is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a computer network.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Level of Operation<\/strong><\/td><td>Operates at a higher level, managing the state and context of the interaction.<\/td><td>Operates at a lower level, handling data transfer between systems.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>State Management<\/strong><\/td><td>Maintains state information (like user data, and preferences) across multiple requests.<\/td><td>Stateless, each socket communication is independent unless managed at a higher level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Protocol<\/strong><\/td><td>Often uses HTTP\/HTTPS in web applications, which are stateless but session management provides state.<\/td><td>Uses transport layer protocols such as TCP or UDP.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>12<\/strong>. <strong>Explain about Agile model.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. Agile is a way of developing software that focuses on delivering value to customers quickly and efficiently. Instead of working on a big project, agile teams break the work into smaller parts and release them in stages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With agile, teams constantly review and adapt their plans, which helps them respond to changes and customer feedback more effectively. This approach leads to higher-quality products with fewer errors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two most popular techniques used in agile are Scrum and Kanban. These methods help teams organize their work, track progress, and collaborate effectively to achieve their goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>13.<\/strong> <strong>Differentiate between white box and black box testing.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Feature <\/td><td>White Box Testing<\/td><td>Black Box Testing<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Focus<\/td><td>Tests internal structures or workings of a system.<\/td><td>Test functionality without knowing internal workings.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Knowledge Required<\/td><td>Requires knowledge of internal code and logic.<\/td><td>Does not require knowledge of internal code.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Design Perspective<\/td><td>Tests based on code structure and implementation.<\/td><td>Tests based on requirements and user perspective.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Testing Techniques<\/td><td>Methods include statement coverage, branch coverage, path coverage, etc.<\/td><td>Methods include equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, etc.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scope<\/td><td>Often used for unit testing or integration testing.<\/td><td>It is  used for system testing or acceptance testing.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Error Detection<\/td><td>Effective in finding logical errors and code bugs.<\/td><td>Focuses on finding discrepancies between expected and actual results.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Examples<\/td><td>Unit testing, integration testing, code review.<\/td><td>Functional testing, regression testing, usability testing.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"20-infosys-hr-interview-questions-for-experienced-2024\">20 Infosys HR Interview Questions For Experienced 2024<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Candidates can refer to the 20 Infosys HR Interview questions for candidates with more than 5 years of experience, Refer to those Infosys Interview questions which are provided below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.<\/strong> <strong>Tell me about yourself.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. I am a highly motivated and hardworking individual with a strong track record of success in my previous roles. Throughout my career, I have developed excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to work effectively independently and as part of a team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my key strengths is learning quickly and adapting to new environments and challenges. I am always eager to take on new responsibilities and expand my skill set. At the same time, I strongly emphasize attention to detail and strive for excellence in everything I do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> I hold a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in [relevant field] from [university name], where I graduated with honors. During my time there, I gained valuable hands-on experience through internships and projects, which helped me develop practical skills to complement my theoretical knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. How do you ensure that all the tasks are completed effectively?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans. <\/strong>If I found myself working under a manager whose leadership style or conduct was extremely problematic, I would take the following professional steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, I would schedule a private meeting with that manager to explain my concerns directly, but respectfully. Often issues can be resolved through open communication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the situation did not improve after that conversation, I would begin documenting specific incidents or examples of the challenges to perform my job duties to the highest standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If those issues persisted or worsened, posing a risk to my work or well-being, I would escalate the matter to Human Resources. Most companies have protocols to review and mediate conflicts between employees impartially.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. If the priorities of the projects are changed how will you manage those?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. If the priorities of the projects I&#8217;m working on get changed, I would take the following steps to manage the shift effectively:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, I will conduct an open discussion with my manager to fully understand the new priorities and reasons. Asking clarifying questions upfront is crucial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I would re-evaluate my current task list and deadlines. I would make adjustments as needed to align with the new priority order. This may involve putting some lower-priority tasks on hold temporarily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear communication would be key throughout this process. I would inform all relevant team members and stakeholders about the updated priorities to remain on the same page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Why do you have a gap in the resume?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans. After working diligently for several years, I took a temporary break from full-time employment for personal reasons. During this period, I devoted time to caring for an elderly family member who required extra assistance. It was an important priority for me to be there for my loved one during a challenging time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I made sure to use this break productively. I took online courses and participated in training programs to keep my technical skills up-to-date. I also volunteered my time with a non-profit organization, allowing me to contribute my expertise while gaining valuable experience in a different environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Tell me about a point in your career where you have made mistakes if any.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ans. There was a time earlier in my career when I made a mistake that taught me a valuable lesson. It was a project where I had multiple tasks and deadlines to manage. I underestimated how long a particular task would take and didn&#8217;t leave enough time to complete it properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, I rushed to finish that task towards the end and the work quality suffered. When I submitted it to my manager, there were avoidable errors that I could have easily caught if I had planned better and given myself more time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6<strong>. Are you fine with working night shifts?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. I am open to working night shifts. I recognize the importance of being flexible in today&#8217;s work environment and am prepared to adapt my schedule to meet the needs of the team and the organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. What is your greatest strength?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. I&#8217;m good at learning new things quickly and adjusting to different situations. I&#8217;m great at solving problems and thinking of creative solutions, especially in fast-paced environments. I&#8217;m super organized so I can manage my tasks well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Why do you want to join Infosys?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. I want to join Infosys because of its reputation for innovation, excellence, and commitment to delivering quality services to clients worldwide. I&#8217;m impressed by the company&#8217;s focus on technology-driven solutions and its dedication to employee growth and development. I believe that joining Infosys will provide opportunities to work on challenging projects, collaborate with talented professionals, and contribute to meaningful initiatives that have a global impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Tell me something which is not mentioned in your resume.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. One thing not mentioned in my resume is my passion for volunteering. In my free time, I actively participate in community service projects, such as organizing food drives for local shelters, tutoring underprivileged children, and participating in environmental clean-up efforts. Volunteering allows me to give back to the community and make a positive difference in the lives of others, which is something I am deeply passionate about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10.&nbsp;What salary are you expecting?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. I&#8217;m looking for a competitive salary that reflects my skills, experience, and the value I can bring to the company. However, I am open to discussing the specific number and am confident that we can reach an agreement &#8211; that is fair for both of us. My main goal is to find a role where I can contribute effectively and grow within the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. What will you do if you are offered a job with a higher salary?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. If I get a job offer with a higher salary, I will think about all parts of the job, not just the money. I care about the work environment, chances to grow in my career, the company culture, and how much I can contribute. If I feel that Infosys is the best place for my career growth and aligns with my values, I would choose to stay with Infosys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>12.

I understand that relocation might be necessary for the role, and I am open to moving to a new location to contribute to the company&#8217;s success and advance my career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>14. How do you handle challenges and work under pressure? Can you provide an example from your previous work experience?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. I once led a team to reprioritize and redeliver a major software implementation project with revised requirements under a tight deadline through careful planning, collaboration, and motivating everyone to go the extra mile. Work Stress and Challenges can be handled with composure, organization, and commitment to continuous improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>15. Are you a team player?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. I was part of a cross-functional team that worked on a large digital transformation project. Despite coming from different backgrounds, we checked our egos at the door and worked cohesively. I made an effort to listen to others&#8217; viewpoints and expertise. At the same time, I didn&#8217;t hesitate to voice my ideas when I saw opportunities for improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>16.<\/strong> <strong>Describe your management style<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ans<\/strong>. As a manager, I would focus on clear communication, supporting my team&#8217;s growth, and creating an environment of teamwork.
