Mid-level professionals (5-10 years) can expect \u20b91,000,000 to \u20b91,500,000 per year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For MERN Developers, the average salary is \u20b9800,000 annually. Entry-level positions start at \u20b9550,000, while experienced developers can earn up to \u20b91,600,000 per year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MEAN Stack Developers in India earn between \u20b9530,000 to \u20b9640,000 per year.

Is MEAN stack better than MERN stack?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. Maintaining a complete architecture is crucial in web development, and that&#8217;s why the MEAN stack is often preferred. It provides an organized framework that supports the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. While the MERN stack also supports MVC design, the MEAN stack is considered more convenient for managing code and upgrades.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1702285005901\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q2. Which is easy MERN or MEAN?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. Learning the MEAN stack can be challenging due to its steep learning curve, while the MERN stack tends to have a more accessible learning curve. Additionally, in terms of data binding, the MEAN stack supports both one-way and two-way data binding, providing more flexibility. On the other hand, the MERN stack only supports one-way data binding.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1702285015209\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q3. Can I get a job with MERN stack?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. In web development, you deal with front-end, back-end, and databases. Among web technologies, MERN Stack is a top choice. If you&#8217;re a MERN Stack Developer, you&#8217;re set for a promising career as it&#8217;s a powerful and highly sought-after skill in the industry.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the world of web development, choosing between MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stacks is a big decision.
