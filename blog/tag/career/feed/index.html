<p>Choosing the right career path after college is definitely one of the most important decisions one takes in their lifetime. This is a decision crucial for understanding the placement of the rest of your life. That’s why it’s absolutely necessary to choose careers in which your interest lies and one which is profitable as well.</p>

<p>However, since the decision is so important for the rest of your life. Some might even find it very difficult to find careers they&#8217;re interested in. Because, such decisions come with a lot of pressure, not just pressure we put on ourselves, but even the pressure that’s put on us by people in our surroundings, such as parents, relatives, friends, teachers, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1792" height="1792" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-179" src="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1111.jpeg" alt="career"></h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-do-after-college-in-india-2024">What to Do After College in India 2024</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-segregate-a-group-of-interests-you-have"><strong>1. Segregate a Group of Interests You Have</strong></h3>



<p>To choose the perfect career, we should first list out many subjects/career paths that interest you and then segregate the paths.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-the-scope-it-has-in-the-future"><strong>2. The Scope it Has in the Future</strong></h3>



<p>It is very important to be mindful while choosing a future and know what importance it holds shortly. As that technology impacts the job opportunities provided by the stream.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-the-pay"><strong>3. The Pay</strong></h3>



<p>Knowing the average payment received by people in a particular stream, helps us classify whether or not to choose the future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-the-skills-required"><strong>4. The Skills Required</strong></h3>



<p>When we’re choosing a path it is also very important to know the skills, and tasks that you are expected to learn to land a good job.<br>for example, in the hotel management industry employees are expected to know how to communicate efficiently with their co-workers as well as clients, and are also expected to know how to serve those are vital skills, on the other hand, a software engineer is expected to know coding, computer-related skills, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-review"><strong>5. Review</strong></h3>



<p>A few other very important things to consider before choosing a future to review with other presently working professionals and career counselors are very important when we’re stuck on what to choose.<br>They usually provide us with information on each work-life and discuss various other factors. They give us a clear view of what we should pursue.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-pros-and-cons-list"><strong>6. Pros and Cons List</strong></h3>



<p>Another very helpful method in the choosing process, making a pros and cons list will broaden the advantages and disadvantages of each work.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-proper-research"><strong>7. Proper Research</strong></h3>



<p>Research while choosing a future is a must. Not only should we listen to facts and advice stated by others, but we must also research for ourselves to be fully sure of what we’re going to be working on.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-make-sure-it-is-your-decision"><strong>8. Make Sure It is Your Decision</strong></h3>



<p>This is the most important point. Usually, children get into professions advised or forced by their parents or near ones and this usually leads to hatred of the job or dissatisfaction.</p>



<p>Choosing a career path can be considered the most important decision we make in our life. Thus, we should make sure we make this decision with utmost clarity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/stock-market/"><strong>Stock market trading as a profession.</strong></a></h1>
<h2><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" src="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/WhatsApp-Image-2023-05-23-at-14.04.02.jpeg" alt="stock market" width="1600" height="1600" />What is the stock market?</h2>
<p>The stock market also known as the share market or equity market is a market where we can buy or sell a company’s shares.<br />
Buying shares means buying some percentage of ownership of that company.<br />
Selling shares means selling some percentage of ownership of your company.</p>
<h3>What is trading?</h3>
<p>Trading means buying something and then selling the same at an increased price so that profit can be made.</p>
<h3>What is stock market trading?</h3>
<p>Buying shares in the stock market and as soon as the price of shares increases selling it to earn profit is called stock market trading.</p>
<h3><strong>How to start trading?</strong></h3>
<p>The step-by-step analysis for you to have a successful trading career:<br />
<strong>1. Mindset-The right mindset for trading is essential for trading. Avoid falling into the toxic cycle of:</strong><br />
-Gambling<br />
-Expectation of quick profit<br />
-No regular income from trading<br />
It is vital for most traders to understand that trading grants you irregular income when you are a beginner or intermediate trader.<br />
While beginning it is very important to come in with a trainee mindset, i.e., not get too influenced by quick profits, don’t get influenced by money.</p>
<p><strong>2. In order to execute trading we need a Demat account.</strong><br />
example, Kotak Mahindra securities,icici securities, bicep securities, etc.<br />
There are two types of brokers:<br />
-Discount brokers<br />
-Full-service brokers<br />
For beginners, it is recommended to go with discount brokers,</p>
<p><strong>3. To make a watchlist</strong><br />
We need to decide what to trade on, what shares to trade, and what trade to sell.</p>
<p><strong>4. Paper trading</strong><br />
Paper trading is a simulated trade that allows a trader to practice buying and selling without risking real money.<br />
Applying strategies, such as:<br />
-Backtesting<br />
-Forward testing<br />
and check whether your strategy work.</p>
<p>One of the biggest questions is whether it is worth leaving your job in order to become a full-time trader<br />
<a href="https://groww.in/blog/how-to-build-a-career-in-the-stock-market" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Full-time trading?</strong></a></p>
<p>• Is it possible to make a career in the stock market l<br />
Yes, definitely.Though there is no proper training in trading in the stock market.<br />
• Should we quit our job to become full-time trader?<br />
No, doing anything extremely risky for the stock market during the first initial years of trading(beginner, intermediate) is not recommended.</p>
<p>It is very important to understand the risk that comes with stock market trading in order to make it a full-time job. We must first have enough capital to bank on, in case something goes wrong in trading. There is a high probability that something may go wrong as this field is very tough.</p>
<p>-It is essential to start with being a part-time trader.<br />
-Learn the process.<br />
-Learn from your mistakes.</p>
