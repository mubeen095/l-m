</ol>



<p>The installation process is generally quick and efficient. On a Windows computer with 1 GB of free memory, an SSD hard drive, and an i5 CPU, the Java installation wizard can complete the setup in less than a minute, ensuring a swift and hassle-free experience for users.</p>



<p><strong>Where to install Java on Windows?</strong></p>



<p>Changing the default installation directory for Java on your Windows system can be a wise choice, especially if you want to avoid potential issues with spaces in folder names like &#8220;Program Files.&#8221; Here are some recommended alternative installation paths:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>C:\tool\jdk17</strong>: This directory structure provides a dedicated location for your Java installation, making it easy to locate and manage.</li>



<li><strong>C:\jdk17\</strong>: A straightforward path like this allows for easy access and avoids spaces in the directory name, reducing the likelihood of script errors.</li>



<li><strong>C:\java\version\17</strong>: This structured approach organizes Java installations by version number, which can be useful if you work with multiple Java versions.</li>
</ol>



<p>By choosing one of these alternative installation directories, you can ensure a smooth and error-free experience when working with Java on your Windows computer.</p>



<p><strong>Set the Java PATH</strong></p>



<p>Allowing the installer to configure the Java PATH environment variable is highly recommended, and here&#8217;s why:</p>

<p>Configuring the JAVA_HOME environment variable is essential for many Java-based programs, including popular applications like Minecraft and Apache Tomcat. Here&#8217;s why it&#8217;s recommended to let the Java install wizard handle this task:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Many Java-based programs query the JAVA_HOME environment variable to locate the Java installation path. By allowing the install wizard to configure JAVA_HOME, you ensure compatibility and smooth operation of these applications.</li>



<li><strong>Automation</strong>: Allowing the installer to set up JAVA_HOME automates the process and reduces the chances of errors. This eliminates the need for manual configuration, saving you time and effort.</li>



<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Using the installer&#8217;s default settings ensures consistency across your system and avoids potential discrepancies in environment variable values.</li>
</ol>



<p>However, it&#8217;s worth noting that not all Java installers configure these environment variables automatically. In such cases, you may need to configure them manually. Fortunately, there are tutorials available to guide you through the process of setting up JAVA_HOME or configuring the Java PATH when needed.</p>



<p>In general, it&#8217;s advisable to follow the installer&#8217;s recommendations and allow it to configure JAVA_HOME for you, but having knowledge of manual configuration can be valuable in cases where it&#8217;s necessary.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="validate-java-home-on-windows">Validate JAVA_HOME on Windows</h3>



<p>To verify that the JAVA_HOME environment variable has been set correctly on your Windows system, you can use either the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. Here&#8217;s how to do it:</p>



<p>Using the Windows Command Prompt:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>C:\&gt;echo %JAVA_HOME%</code></pre>



<p>Using PowerShell:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>PS C:\&gt; echo $env:JAVA_HOME</code></pre>



<p>Regardless of whether you use the Command Prompt or PowerShell, the output of the command should be the root folder where you installed Java. This confirms that the JAVA_HOME environment variable has been correctly configured, ensuring that Java-based applications and development tools can access the Java installation on your system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="confirm-the-java-path-configuration">Confirm the Java PATH configuration</h3>
