<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which Of The Following Is Cloud Computing Key Enabling Technologies</h2>



<p>Answer.</p>



<p>Cloud computing relies on several key enabling technologies to function efficiently and provide its various services. These technologies include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Distributed Computing (Cluster, Grid Computing)</strong>: Distributed computing forms the basis for cloud computing by allowing resources to be distributed and shared across multiple machines and locations. Cluster and grid computing technologies help in achieving this by harnessing the power of multiple interconnected servers to work together efficiently.</li>



<li><strong>Internet Technologies (Service-oriented Architecture, Web 3.0, etc.)</strong>: Internet technologies, such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), play a significant role in enabling the delivery of cloud services over the internet. Web 3.0 and related concepts emphasize more intelligent and interconnected web services, which can enhance cloud computing capabilities.</li>



<li><strong>Hardware Technologies (Multi-core Chips, Virtualization, etc.)</strong>: Hardware technologies like multi-core processors and virtualization are fundamental to cloud computing. Multi-core chips provide the processing power required to run virtualized instances efficiently, while virtualization technology allows for the creation and management of virtual machines and containers.</li>



<li><strong>System Management Technologies (Automatic Computing)</strong>: System management technologies, including automation and orchestration, are crucial for efficiently provisioning, configuring, and managing cloud resources. Automatic computing, which involves automated tasks and self-healing systems, helps maintain the stability and reliability of cloud environments.</li>
</ol>



<p>These technologies collectively enable cloud computing to deliver scalable, flexible, and on-demand services to users and organizations. They facilitate the efficient use of resources, the rapid deployment of applications, and the management of complex infrastructure in a cost-effective manner.</p>
