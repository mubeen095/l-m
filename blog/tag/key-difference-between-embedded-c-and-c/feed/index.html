<p>In the world of C programming, initially, we can understand the key difference between C and Embedded C. Moreover, we know that C language is mainly used for desktop-based application and is high level programming language which is made for developing several applications. In contrast, Embedded C is the extension of the C programming language. Let us take a look at the difference between Embedded C and C.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="functions-of-c-language">Functions of C Language </h3>



<p>a. Used to develop desktop-based applications </p>



<p>b. C programming language can generate .exe files.</p>



<p>c. It has unlimited resources such as memory </p>



<p>d. Utilizes the system OS memory </p>



<p>e. Following a free and straightforward form of program coding.</p>



<p>f. The optimization is standard </p>



<p>e. Making changes in C language is easy.</p>



<p>f. Fixing bugs is easy </p>



<p>e.  In C  programming language, it is possible to give input to the program while running.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="functions-of-embedded-c">Functions of Embedded C </h3>



<p>a. Used to develop microcontroller &#8211; based applications. </p>



<p>b. Generates .hex files </p>



<p>c. Embedded C has resources like RAM and ROM</p>



<p>d. It has high optimization </p>



<p>e. It finds it difficult to make changes .</p>



<p>f. Bug fixing is comparatively difficult</p>

<div id="faq-question-1691387319315" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q1. What is the difference between C and Embedded C Quora?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. There is only one C language. If you use C on computers then it is called regular C. If you use C on Electronics then it is called &#8220;Embedded C&#8221;. In both the  cases the compiled C program is executed by the Microprocessor only.</p>

<div id="faq-question-1691387346988" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q2. Why C is used in embedded systems, not C++?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. C is this low-level programming language is often used for embedded software development since it offers efficient memory management and hardware access. It is also a simpler language than C++ and can be easier to learn</p>

<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q3. Which language is best for embedded system?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. Due to its effectiveness, C is the most used embedded computer programming language. The C programming language is used to create around 80% of embedded devices. It is portable, irrespective of the type of processor, and structured. Without a lot of adjustments, it might run on several systems.</p>
