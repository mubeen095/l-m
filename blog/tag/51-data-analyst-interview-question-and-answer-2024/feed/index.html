<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Data Analyst Interview Question And Answer </h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Data Mining vs. Data Profiling:</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Data Mining:</strong> It is the process of discovering patterns, correlations, and trends within large datasets. The goal is to extract useful information and knowledge from the data. Data mining involves various techniques such as clustering, classification, regression, and association rule mining.</li>



<li><strong>Data Profiling:</strong> It is the process of examining and summarizing the content, structure, and quality of available data. The main objective is to understand the characteristics of the data, identify anomalies, and assess its fitness for a specific purpose. Data profiling helps in preparing data for further analysis.</li>
</ul>



<p>2.<strong>Data Wrangling in Data Analytics:</strong></p>



<p>Ans,</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Data wrangling (or data munging):</strong> It refers to the process of cleaning, structuring, and enriching raw data into a desired format for better decision making in less time. This involves cleaning and handling missing data, transforming variables, and combining datasets. It is a crucial step in the data preparation phase of analytics.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Data Quality Check:</strong> EDA is crucial for understanding the quality and integrity of the data.</li>
</ul>



<p>8.<strong>Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analytics:</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Descriptive Analytics:</strong> Involves summarizing and interpreting historical data to describe what has happened.</li>



<li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Involves forecasting future trends based on historical data and modeling.</li>



<li><strong>Prescriptive Analytics:</strong> Recommends actions to optimize outcomes based on predictions.</li>
</ul>



<p>9.<strong>Sampling Techniques Used by Data Analysts:</strong></p>



<p>Ans.</p>
