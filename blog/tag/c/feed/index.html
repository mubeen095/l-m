<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css-full-form">CSS Full Form</h2>



<p>CSS stands for&nbsp;Cascading Style Sheet, it is a style sheet language used to shape the HTML elements that will be displayed in the browsers as a web page Elevating Web Design and User Experience. In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, few acronyms have wielded as much influence as CSS – Cascading Style Sheets. </p>



<p>CSS has transformed the way we perceive and interact with websites, playing a pivotal role in shaping the aesthetics and user experience of the digital realm. This article delves into the origin, significance, workings, and evolution of CSS, shedding light on how it has revolutionized web design.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css-full-form-origins-and-evolution">CSS Full Form- Origins and Evolution</h2>



<p><br>CSS emerged as a response to the growing complexity of web pages and the need for a standardized method to control their presentation. It was introduced in the late 1990s as a means to separate the content of a webpage from its appearance. </p>



<p>Before CSS, styling information was often embedded within HTML tags, leading to convoluted and challenging-to-maintain code. With CSS, designers gained the ability to define styles externally, paving the way for more organized and efficient web development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css-full-form-the-concept-of-cascading">CSS Full Form-The Concept of Cascading</h2>



<p><br>The term &#8220;cascading&#8221; in CSS refers to the hierarchy of styles that can be applied to an HTML element. Multiple style sources can influence an element&#8217;s appearance – from inline styles within the HTML tag to styles in external CSS files. </p>



<p>If conflicts arise between these sources, the &#8220;cascading&#8221; nature of CSS dictates that the styles will be applied in a specific order of priority. This allows for a fine-tuned and flexible approach to designing and styling web content.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css-full-form-styling-and-design">CSS Full Form &#8211; Styling and Design</h2>



<p><br>CSS&#8217;s primary function is to control the visual presentation of HTML elements. Designers utilize CSS properties to define aspects such as colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and responsiveness. CSS empowers them to create visually appealing and consistent designs across different devices and screen sizes, contributing to a seamless user experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css-full-form-separation-of-concerns">CSS Full Form &#8211; Separation of Concerns</h2>



<p>One of the key principles behind CSS is the separation of concerns, which entails separating the structure (HTML) from the presentation (CSS) and functionality (JavaScript) of a web page. This separation enhances code maintainability, collaboration, and reusability. Styling changes can be made in the CSS file without altering the underlying content, promoting efficient development and updates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css-full-form-responsive-design">CSS Full Form -Responsive Design</h2>



<p>With the proliferation of mobile devices and varying screen sizes, responsive design has become imperative. CSS&#8217;s flexibility enables developers to design responsive layouts that adapt gracefully to different screens. Media queries, a CSS feature, allow styles to be applied based on factors like screen width, ensuring optimal user experiences on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css-full-form-frameworks-and-preprocessors">CSS Full Form &#8211; Frameworks and Preprocessors</h2>



<p>The popularity of CSS has given rise to frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation, which provide pre-built CSS components and styles. These frameworks expedite development by offering a standardized foundation that developers can build upon. Additionally, CSS preprocessors like SASS and LESS extend CSS&#8217;s capabilities by introducing variables, functions, and modularization, simplifying the process of writing and maintaining complex stylesheets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css-full-form-challenges-and-evolution">CSS Full Form &#8211; Challenges and Evolution</h2>



<p><br>While CSS has brought significant advancements to web design, it also presents challenges. Maintaining consistency across browsers can be a struggle due to browser-specific rendering issues. However, ongoing efforts within the web development community, along with modern browser standards, have mitigated many of these challenges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="css-full-form-conclusion">CSS Full Form &#8211; Conclusion</h2>



<p><br>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) stands as an essential pillar of modern web development. Its ability to define visual elements, facilitate responsive design, and enforce separation of concerns has transformed how websites are created and experienced. </p>



<p>As the digital landscape continues to evolve, CSS remains at the forefront of design innovation, enabling developers to craft captivating, user-centric, and visually engaging web experiences that resonate across diverse audiences and devices. </p>



<p>The legacy of CSS is one of empowerment, as it empowers designers and developers alike to sculpt the aesthetics and interactivity of the online world.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="html-full-form">HTML Full Form</h2>



<p>HTML Full Form: HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the cornerstone of web development. It structures web content using tags, dictating how elements like headings, images, and links are displayed. However, HTML focuses on structure, not style or interactivity. To make web pages appealing and engaging, developers employ Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for design and JavaScript for interactivity. CSS controls colors, fonts, and layouts, while JavaScript adds dynamic elements and user interactions. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the core trio powering the captivating web experiences we enjoy daily.</p>



<p>A Deep Dive into Hypertext Markup Language. In the vast realm of the digital world, where websites, applications, and online content reign supreme, one term stands out as the cornerstone of it all &#8211; HTML. Standing for &#8220;Hypertext Markup Language,&#8221; HTML is the bedrock upon which the World Wide Web is built. This article delves into HTML Full Form into the origins, structure, significance, and evolution of HTML, exploring how it has shaped the way we interact with information on the internet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="html-full-form-origins-and-evolution">HTML Full Form -Origins and Evolution</h2>



<p><br>The story of HTML traces back to the early 1990s when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, along with his team at CERN, conceptualized the idea of a global information-sharing platform. Their goal was to create a system that allowed researchers to share and access information easily. In pursuit of this vision, Berners-Lee introduced the concept of hypertext, where documents could be linked together, forming a web of interconnected information. To facilitate this, he designed HTML as a markup language that could structure and link documents in a way that was easily understandable by both humans and computers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="html-full-form-markup-language">HTML Full Form &#8211; Markup Language</h2>



<p><br>At its core, HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. This distinction is important because HTML focuses on defining the structure and presentation of content rather than instructing a computer to perform specific actions. HTML uses tags &#8211; enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; &gt;) &#8211; to define elements within a document. These tags provide instructions on how the content should be displayed or organized, ranging from headings and paragraphs to images, links, and multimedia elements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="html-full-form-structure-and-syntax">HTML Full Form- Structure and Syntax</h2>



<p><br>HTML documents are composed of a hierarchy of elements, starting with the root element, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, which encapsulates the entire document.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-internal-and-external-fragmentation-in-os">What Is the Internal And External Fragmentation In OS?</h2>



<p>This article will discuss what is the internal and external fragmentation in OS. Moreover, it will also provide an idea of what fragmentation is, the main difference between internal and external fragmentation. </p>



<p>In computer systems, we deal with two types of memory waste: internal and external fragmentation. </p>



<p>Internal fragmentation happens when we allocate more memory than needed, leaving empty space. External fragmentation occurs when free memory is scattered in small pieces, making it hard to find enough space for big tasks. These concepts help us use memory better. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-fragmentation">What is Fragmentation?</h2>



<p>Simply put, fragmentation is misused for data storage and their ability might be reduced. So, the impact of fragmentation is determined by the individual fragmentation type and use of a unique storage space allocation strategy. Moreover, the ram functions to retrieve the data set (for example, file format ) which is equivalent to other systems. </p>



<p>The operating system will allow the storage of components that are stored in chunks only when a computer program wants them. Therefore, after ending a software program, it can be put into a system and moved back to the following or related following. This software can retrieve chunks for varying lengths of time and in different sizes. </p>



<p>Hence, computer programming can request and release several storage blocks during its existence. Moreover, the unused memory areas are large and continuous when a system starts. The continuous sector breaks up through time and is further utilized into smaller sections of the land. Whereas, large continuous storage blocks are very difficult to access.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fragmentation-in-os">Fragmentation in OS</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="internal-fragmentation">Internal Fragmentation</h3>



<p>This process contains a bigger memory block assigned to it. Therefore, some memory is left unused as another process cannot utilize it. Thus, the lower partition is big enough for the process and will be chosen to reduce internal fragmentation. We can also use the Best Fit Block to fix the internal fragmentation.</p>



<p> Internal fragmentation will occur when it uses less or more space than the assigned block. Hence,  When there is a mismatch between the assigned necessary memory space. This is referred to as internal fragmentation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="external-fragmentation">External Fragmentation</h3>



<p>The sum of money is necessary to handle a request or house a process, however, it cannot be used as it is not contiguous. External fragmentation occurs when a segment is applied.  We know that when a process is removed from the main memory, external fragmentation will occur. In short, we can understand that external fragmentation occurs only when the memory portion allocated is of different sizes. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="variations-of-fragmentation">Variations of Fragmentation</h2>



<p>Memory is divided into little blocks and fragments are inherently non -contiguous. Hence, we are unable to assign them to process. Therefore, the process gets pending and some unused blocks remain in the memory. Hence, internal and external fragmentation will be possible. </p>



<p>Internal fragmentation happens when we allocate memory for a process that can be bigger than the requested memory and will divide the physical memory into contiguous mounted-sized chunks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the space can&#8217;t be used for other processes. External fragmentation happens when there is unused RAM to fit in all the allocation requests.&nbsp;Memory is not continuous in this case. Hence, the RAM has many vacant blocks which are very small to be assigned in other applications. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fragmentation-of-operating-systems">Fragmentation of Operating Systems</h2>



<p>Processes are provided space in the computer’s storage system when it is loaded. Then, this space is divided between fixed partitioning (in which the size of partitions is fixed before any process is loaded into memory) and dynamic partitioning (where the size of partitions is decided at the run time, and it is mainly according to the size of the process) (where the size of partitions is decided at the run time and it is primarily according to the size of the process).</p>



<p>Hence, the processes are removed from memory in a similar process as it was added to it, fragmenting the available free space. Therefore, we know that these primary results are tiny, underutilized fragmented memory locations and so, are too small to support usual activities.</p>

<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q3.What is an example of internal fragmentation?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. The Operating System uses a part of this RAM. Let&#8217;s suppose a process P1 with a size of 3MB arrives and is given a memory block of 4MB. As a result, the 1MB of free space in this block is unused and cannot be used to allocate memory to another process. It is known as internal fragmentation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-difference-between-binary-search-and-linear-search">What Is The Difference Between Binary Search And Linear Search?</h2>



<p>Welcome to our exploration of two fundamental search algorithms: binary search and linear search. In the realm of computer science and programming, these techniques play pivotal roles in efficiently locating specific elements within a collection of data. Whether you are an aspiring programmer, a curious enthusiast, or a seasoned developer seeking a refresher, this article will delve into the key distinctions and inner workings of binary search and linear search. </p>



<p>Join us as we embark on a journey to unravel the mysteries behind these search algorithms and discover when and how to best utilize them in solving real-world problems. Let&#8217;s dive in and understand the fundamental differences between these two essential methods of data retrieval.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="linear-search">Linear Search </h2>



<p>Linear search, also called sequential search, is a way to find something in a random list of stuff. You start from the beginning and check each item one by one. If you find what you&#8217;re looking for, you tell the position. If not, you keep going until the end of the list. If you still can&#8217;t find it, you say &#8220;Sorry, I couldn&#8217;t find it&#8221; by returning -1. It&#8217;s a simple method, but it can take a while for large lists or if the thing you want is far down the list. There are smarter ways to find things faster, but this is the basic one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="code-syntax-for-the-linear-search">Code Syntax for the Linear Search.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><code>/ Linear Search in C++</code><br><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code><br><code>usingnamespacestd;</code><br><code>intsearch(intarray[], intn, intx){&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Going through array sequencially&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;for(inti = 0; i &lt; n; i++)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(array[i] == x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>returni;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>return-1;}</code></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="binary-search">Binary Search </h2>



<p>In binary search, we use a smarter way to find something in a sorted list. Instead of checking each item one by one like in linear search, we start by looking at the middle item of the list. If the middle item is what we&#8217;re looking for, great, we&#8217;re done! But if it&#8217;s not, we know whether the item we want is in the first half or the second half of the list.</p>



<p>So, we cut down our search to half right away. If the middle item is greater than what we&#8217;re looking for, we know the item we want must be in the first half of the list. Otherwise, it must be in the second half. Hence, Binary search is more efficient than linear search, especially for large sorted lists, because it eliminates half of the remaining search space at each step, searching faster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="code-syntax-for-the-binary-search">Code Syntax for the Binary Search</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code><br><code>usingnamespacestd;</code><br><code>intbinarySearch(intarray[], intx, intlow, inthigh){&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>// Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;// other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>while(low &lt;= high) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intmid = low + (high - low) / 2;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(array[mid] == x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returnmid;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;if(array[mid] &lt; x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;low = mid + 1;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;high = mid - 1;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;return-1;</code><br><code>}</code></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="main-difference-of-linear-search-and-binary-search">Main Difference Of Linear Search and Binary Search</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong><em>Linear Search </em></strong></td><td><strong><em>Binary Search</em></strong></td></tr><tr><td>In linear search, input data doesn&#8217;t need to be sorted .</td><td>Whereas, in binary search, input data has to be sorted according to the order.</td></tr><tr><td>It is also referred as sequential search.</td><td>It is also referred to as half-interval search.</td></tr><tr><td>The time complexity of the linear search is O(n)</td><td>The time complexity of the binary search is<br> 0 (logn)</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-dimensional array is used for linear search.</td><td>A single dimensional array is used for linear search.</td></tr><tr><td>It operates equality comparisons</td><td>Binary search operates ordering comparisons</td></tr><tr><td>Linear search is less complex and involves a slow process </td><td>Binary search is more complex and has a fast process</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion </h2>



<p>Linear search is simple and works with any type of list, whether it&#8217;s sorted or not. It checks each item one by one, starting from the beginning, until it finds the target item or reaches the end of the list. While easy to understand, it may be slow for large lists, especially if the item is far down the list.</p>



<p>On the other hand, binary search is more efficient, but it requires the list to be sorted. It starts by checking the middle item and narrows down the search to half the list based on whether the target item is greater or smaller than the middle. It keeps repeating this process, cutting down the search space in half with each step, until it finds the target or can&#8217;t narrow it down further. Binary search is ideal for large sorted lists, as it quickly finds the target item.</p>



<p>In summary, use linear search for small or unsorted lists, and binary search for large sorted lists when you need faster results. Each method has its strengths, and understanding their differences helps you choose the right approach for your specific problem.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-characteristics-of-dbms">What Are The Characteristics Of DBMS?</h2>



<p>Characteristics of DBMS: In the world of modern computing, managing vast amounts of data is a critical challenge faced by individuals and organizations alike. To address this complexity, Database Management Systems (DBMS) have emerged as powerful tools that simplify data organization, retrieval, and manipulation. These software systems offer a wide array of characteristics designed to optimize data management processes, enhance data security, and ensure data integrity. In this article, we will explore the fundamental characteristics of DBMS that make it an indispensable asset in the ever-evolving landscape of data-driven technologies. From data independence and security to query optimization and multi-user support, understanding the characteristics of DBMS lays the foundation for comprehending their significance in modern data-driven applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="characteristics-of-dbms">Characteristics of DBMS </h2>



<p>1.<strong>Real-World Entity</strong>: A distinguishing characteristic of a Database Management System (DBMS) is its ability to uniquely represent real-world entities in a structured and organized manner. A DBMS excels in creating a comprehensive and easily understandable mapping of real-world objects, relationships, and properties, transforming them into distinct data entities within the database.</p>



<p>When designing a student database, for instance, each student is represented as a unique record in the system, with attributes such as name, age, gender, and roll number, aligning precisely with the specific characteristics of the students.</p>



<p>This uniqueness in data representation allows the DBMS to efficiently manage, retrieve, and manipulate vast amounts of information related to various aspects of businesses or organizations. By safeguarding data integrity and ensuring secure handling of large datasets, the DBMS becomes an indispensable tool, seamlessly bridging the gap between the physical world and the digital realm, ultimately providing a reliable and singular source of real-world information whenever required.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Self-explaining nature</strong>: In DBMS, databases can contain other databases, and each database also contains metadata, which refers to data about the data itself. For instance, in a school database, information like the total number of rows and the names of tables would be considered metadata. The self-explaining nature of the database arises from the fact that all the data is stored in a structured format, enabling automatic understanding and organization of information.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Atomicity of Operations (Transactions)</strong></p>



<p>Atomicity is a crucial characteristic provided by DBMS (Database Management System), ensuring that an operation is either fully completed or not performed at all. It plays a vital role in guaranteeing the integrity of transactions, especially in scenarios like bank transactions.</p>



<p>For instance, when Sona wants to transfer 1000 rupees to Archita&#8217;s account, the atomicity feature ensures that either the entire transaction is successful, deducting the money from Sona&#8217;s account and crediting it to Archita&#8217;s account, or no changes occur at all. In case of any problem during the transaction, the atomicity feature automatically reverses the process, returning the money to Sona&#8217;s account.</p>



<p>The smooth functioning of the database is pivotal for a successful transaction, and any failure in atomicity could disrupt the entire banking server. Hence, atomicity stands as the most critical and useful characteristic of DBMS, ensuring the reliability and consistency of operations within the database.</p>



<p>4. <strong>Concurrent Access without Anomalies</strong></p>



<p>In the world of Database Management Systems (DBMS), the concurrent feature stands as a remarkable characteristic. It enables multiple users to access the Database simultaneously, fetching information without any disruptions or anomalies. A real-world example in a bank scenario demonstrates the power of concurrency. When Sonu gives his ATM card to Archita, who withdraws 5000 rupees, and at the same time, Sonu transfers 2000 rupees to Monu, both operations succeed smoothly. The bank balance accurately reflects the resulting 3000 rupees, showcasing the flawless updation made possible by the concurrent feature. This capability of DBMS proves invaluable, ensuring seamless and efficient data access for numerous users concurrently.</p>



<p>5. <strong>Stores Any Kind of Structured Data</strong></p>



<p>One of the fundamental characteristics of a Database Management System (DBMS) is its capability to store data in a structured format. While many examples focus on student databases for better comprehension, it is essential to recognize that DBMS can accommodate an unlimited amount of data.</p>



<p>DBMS possesses the versatility to store various types of real-world data in a structured manner, making it another critical aspect of this technology. Whether it&#8217;s financial records, customer information, inventory data, or any other form of data, DBMS can organize and manage them effectively, ensuring data integrity and easy retrieval. This inherent ability to structure and store diverse data types contributes significantly to the widespread application and importance of DBMS in modern information-driven environments.</p>



<p>6. <strong>Integrity</strong></p>



<p>Consider a bank, ABC Bank, which maintains its customer data in a Database. If an attempt is made to enter the account details of a customer who is not registered with the bank, the Database would provide an incorrect output. Additionally, if a customer updates their address but the new address is not reflected in the Database, it leads to data inconsistency.</p>



<p>To ensure integrity, the data stored in the Database should be accurate and consistent with real-world information. For instance, if a customer&#8217;s account balance is initially zero and later the customer deposits 6000 rupees, the new balance must be promptly updated in the Database. Failure to do so would result in an erroneous representation of the customer&#8217;s financial status, causing inconvenience and problems for the customer.</p>



<p>Thus, maintaining data integrity is vital to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information stored in the Database, avoiding inconsistencies and providing a seamless and reliable experience for the users.</p>



<p>7. <strong>Ease of Access (The DBMS Queries)</strong></p>



<p>Before the advent of DBMS, data was stored using a file and folder system, which made searching for specific information, like a student&#8217;s name, a laborious and time-consuming task. Each search operation had to be performed manually within the files and folders. However, with the introduction of DBMS, accessing data became significantly easier.</p>



<p>In DBMS, we can effortlessly retrieve any type of stored data by executing simple search operation queries. This process is much faster and more efficient compared to manual searching. DBMS offers a range of operations known as CRUD (Create, Read, Update &amp; Delete), allowing us to implement various types of queries within the Database. These CRUD operations provide a standardized and structured approach to manage and manipulate data effectively. As a result, DBMS revolutionized data management, making it more accessible and convenient for users in various applications and industries.</p>



<p>8. <strong>SQL and No-SQL Databases</strong></p>



<p>SQL databases organize data into structured tables with rows and columns, providing a rigid and relational approach to storage. Conversely, No-SQL databases offer flexibility, enabling data storage in various formats beyond traditional tables. For instance, MongoDB, a popular No-SQL database, adopts JSON for data representation.</p>



<p>The beauty lies in the ability to choose the ideal database type for a specific project. Instead of debating which is better, SQL or No-SQL, we can embrace both, capitalizing on their respective strengths and suitability for different use cases.</p>



<p>DBMS, with its versatile nature, facilitates seamless operations on both SQL and No-SQL databases. Users can effortlessly run queries and execute operations on diverse databases, empowering them to optimize data management based on the unique requirements of each project.</p>



<p>9. <strong>ACID Properties</strong></p>



<p>ACID properties &#8211; Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability &#8211; maintain data integrity in DBMS. Transactions are either fully completed or not at all (Atomicity). Changes bring data from one valid state to another (Consistency). Multiple transactions occur independently (Isolation). Successful transactions are permanent (Durability).</p>



<p>10.  <strong>Security</strong></p>



<p>Database access must be limited for users to prevent unauthorized access and changes. Authentication ensures users have specific rights to access the Database, allowing only authorized actions. For example, administrators may modify the entire Database, while regular employees can only edit their personal profiles.</p>
